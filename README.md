â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Forest_generator.py #Procedural tree generation in Maya using Python. This script creates "trees" with random trunk and leaf positions, rotation, and scaling. It also generates a forest of trees at random positions,                       suitable for creating dynamic environments for 3D scenes or animation projects. Plug and play custom models.

Maya Automation: Tools for optimizing workflows, including object manipulation, naming conventions, and retopology helpers.
Unreal Integration (Soon): Planned tools for automating workflows in UE.

ðŸ“Œ Getting Started

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/daphfodils/TA_Scripts.git
Open Maya and load a script via the Script Editor or MEL command:
exec(open("path/to/script.py").read())
Modify and use freely!

ðŸ’¡ Future Plans

âœ… Expand Python automation for Maya

âœ… Add C++ tools for Unreal

âœ… Create UI-based scripts for better usability
