# TA_Scripts
ðŸš€ A collection of scripts and tools for Technical Art, focusing on automation in Maya and (eventually) Unreal Engine.

                                        trunk and leaf positions, rotation, and scaling. It also generates a forest of trees at
                                        random positions, suitable for creating dynamic environments for 3D scenes or animation

                                        3D objects. It supports predefined object types (trees and rocks, but easily editable),
                                        creates and assign colors to shaders based on names or RGB values, and applies
                                        transformations like scaling and positioning.

ðŸ›  Features

Maya Automation: Tools for optimizing workflows, including object manipulation, naming conventions, and retopology helpers.
Unreal Integration (Soon): Planned tools for automating workflows in UE.

ðŸ“Œ Getting Started

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/daphfodils/TA_Scripts.git
Open Maya and load a script via the Script Editor or MEL command:
exec(open("path/to/script.py").read())
Modify and use freely!

ðŸ’¡ Future Plans

âœ… Expand Python automation for Maya

âœ… Add C++ tools for Unreal

âœ… Create UI-based scripts for better usability
